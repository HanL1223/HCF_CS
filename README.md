### Project Background

Hospital Casemix Protocol(HCP) is a national program in Australia to collect de-identified patient data from public and private hospitals.
HCP data includes de-identified clinical, demographic, and financial information related to privately insured patients

#### Analysis Objective

To analyze the HCP dataset to identify trends, insights, and patterns that lead to tangible improvements across four critical domains:

- **Commercial Outcomes:** Enhancing financial sustainability.
- **Patient Care:** Improving clinical quality and patient experience.
- **Resource Allocation:** Optimising the use of staff, facilities, and beds.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Streamlining patient flow and internal processes.

### Analytical Approach

#### Data Quality

No empty columns or duplicate records detected

```
Null Value Exist
False               162
------------------------------------------
Duplicate Value Exist
False                    30615
```

By inspect data, we can see empty columns containing space

Given this is a medical dataset, is likely Missing Not At Random and should not be filled.

A decision is leave label it as **NA** at **Data preparation** stage
